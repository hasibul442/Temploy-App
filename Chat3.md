# **Business Proposal Presentation**

## **Unified On-Demand Work Platform**

---

## **Slide 1: Title**

**[Platform Name]**
*A Unified Platform for Hiring & Earning from Physical Jobs*

**Tagline:**

> Post a job. Take a job. One account.

* Founder: [Your Name]
* Launch Market: Portugal
* Stage: Pre-MVP / MVP

---

## **Slide 2: The Problem**

### Hiring physical workers is broken.

**For people & businesses:**

* Hard to find reliable workers quickly
* No transparency in pricing
* No guarantee of job completion
* Unsafe offline payments

**For workers:**

* Limited access to short-term jobs
* Delayed or unpaid work
* No flexibility
* No reputation system

👉 Existing solutions are **slow**, **fragmented**, or **unfair**.

---

## **Slide 3: The Opportunity**

### Physical work is everywhere — but poorly digitized.

* Cleaning, helpers, delivery, events, maintenance
* Students & unemployed people want flexible income
* Small businesses need on-demand help
* Gig economy is growing globally

Yet most platforms focus on:

* Only rides
* Only online freelancing
* Only one-side users

**There is space for a unified solution.**

---

## **Slide 4: The Solution**

### A unified, flexible work platform

**[Platform Name]** allows **any user** to:

* ➕ Post a job
* 🛠️ Apply or accept a job
* 💰 Pay and get paid securely
* ⭐ Build a two-way reputation

All in **one app**, **one account**, **one wallet**.

---

## **Slide 5: Unified User Model (Key Differentiator)**

### One user. Two roles.

Every user can:

* Act as a **client** when posting jobs
* Act as a **worker** when accepting jobs

**Benefits:**

* Higher engagement
* Faster platform growth
* More trust (real people with history)
* No friction switching roles

Similar to Airbnb’s model — not Uber’s.

---

## **Slide 6: Job Posting Flow**

1. User posts a job:

   * Job type
   * Location
   * Time & duration
   * Description
2. User selects job speed:

   * ⚡ **Urgent (Fast match)**
   * 📋 **Flexible (Review offers)**

Simple decision. Clear expectations.

---

## **Slide 7: Urgent Mode – Live Match & Bidding**

### For immediate needs

**How it works:**

* Nearby verified workers receive instant notification
* Workers can:

  * Accept suggested price, or
  * Place a quick bid (within limits)
* Client sees top 3–5 offers
* Client selects one
* Payment held in escrow
* Worker arrives & completes job
* Payment released

**Best for:**

* Cleaning
* Helpers
* Delivery
* Events
* Last-minute work

---

## **Slide 8: Flexible Mode – Marketplace Bidding**

### For non-urgent or skilled jobs

**How it works:**

* Job visible to wider area
* Workers apply with price & message
* Client reviews:

  * Profiles
  * Ratings
  * Experience
* Client selects worker later
* Escrow → work → payment

**Best for:**

* Electricians
* Plumbers
* Skilled labor
* Planned work

---

## **Slide 9: Worker Experience**

* One verified profile
* Choose when & where to work
* Accept or bid on jobs
* GPS check-in at job location
